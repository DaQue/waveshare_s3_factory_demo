Waveshare ESP32-S3 3.5" Weather Station Bring-up
=================================================

This repo is a bring-up playground for an ESP32-S3 board. It currently focuses on
LCD bring-up with a trial harness.

Features
--------
- ESP-IDF + Rust std setup
- USB-Serial-JTAG input for mode selection and trial annotations
- Auto sweep mode (unattended) and interactive sweep mode
- NVS persistence of last trial marker, last mode, last result, and auto sweep count
- Per-trial display reset/cleanup for repeatable bring-up checks

Prereqs
-------
- ESP Rust toolchain installed via `espup`
- ESP environment vars available from `/home/david/export-esp.sh`

Build
-----
```
source /home/david/export-esp.sh
cargo +esp build -Zbuild-std=std,panic_abort
```

Flash + Monitor
--------------
```
source /home/david/export-esp.sh
cargo +esp run -Zbuild-std=std,panic_abort
```

If `sudo` is required for USB access, use the helper:
```
./scripts/flash.sh
```

To skip sudo (if you already have device permissions):
```
./scripts/flash.sh --no-sudo
```

Trial Flow
----------
1) Open the monitor (via `cargo +esp run ...` or `./scripts/flash.sh`).
2) At boot, the firmware prompts and waits until you enter a valid mode:
   - `a` (default): auto mode, resume from saved trial
   - `a1`: auto mode from trial #1
   - `i`: interactive mode, resume from saved trial
   - `i1`: interactive mode from trial #1
   - `i <n>`: interactive mode from trial `n`
3) Each trial shows solid green, then a blue box with a yellow X.
4) In interactive mode, enter result codes:
   - `p`, `px`, `pxb`, `gx`, `gxb`, `pbn`, `vjg`, `vjb`, `hjgb`, `hjbb`, `n`, `b`
5) In interactive mode, control commands:
   - `r` rerun current trial
   - `jmp <n>` jump to trial `n`
   - `nvs` print persisted marker/state
   - `q` quit interactive mode
   - `h` show help
6) The harness prints progress with base trial number as `#/N` and resets/cleans up between trials.

Notes
-----
- USB-Serial-JTAG is used for input, not UART0.
- Main task stack is configured as `CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE=32768`.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- No response to typing: make sure the board is using USB-Serial-JTAG, not an
  external USB-UART bridge.
- Build errors about the target: ensure `espup` is installed and the environment
  is loaded with `source /home/david/export-esp.sh`.

Recent Orientation Updates (2026-02-21)
---------------------------------------
- Runtime screen orientation now supports all 4 physical directions:
  - `Landscape` (USB right)
  - `LandscapeFlipped` (USB left)
  - `Portrait` (USB bottom)
  - `PortraitFlipped` (USB top)
- Auto mode uses the QMI8658 accelerometer with hysteresis to prevent rapid flip noise.
- Locked mode still uses `landscape`/`portrait`, with optional 180-degree flip.
- Orientation changes trigger framebuffer reallocation and full redraw.
- Touch coordinates are remapped per active orientation.
- Swipe directions are normalized so navigation matches on-screen direction in flipped modes.

Console Commands for Orientation
--------------------------------
- `orientation auto`
- `orientation landscape`
- `orientation portrait`
- `orientation flip on`
- `orientation flip off`
- `orientation flip toggle`
- `orientation flip show`

Behavior Notes
--------------
- `orientation flip ...` is available only when locked to `landscape` or `portrait`.
- In `auto` mode, `orientation flip` prints a guidance message and does not apply.
- Orientation mode and flip are persisted in NVS and survive reboot.

NWS Alerts (Current)
--------------------
- The firmware can poll active NWS alerts from `api.weather.gov`.
- NWS calls include required headers:
  - `User-Agent`
  - `Accept: application/geo+json`
- Current scope defaults to `area=MO`.
- Backward compatibility: `state=XX` is accepted in config and auto-normalized to `area=XX`.
- Alerts config is persisted in NVS:
  - `alerts_enabled`
  - `nws_user_agent`
  - `nws_scope`
  - `flash_time` metadata
- Alert config changes from console apply at runtime (no reboot required).

Console Commands for Alerts / Metadata
--------------------------------------
- `alerts show`
- `alerts on`
- `alerts off`
- `alerts ua <user-agent>`
- `alerts scope <scope>` (example: `area=MO`, `zone=MOZ061`)
- `flash show`
- `flash set-time <text>`

Now View Alert UX
-----------------
- Status text color reflects top alert class:
  - Warning: red
  - Watch: yellow
  - Advisory: amber
- Tapping weather icon:
  - No alerts: weather refresh
  - Alerts present: open/close alert details overlay
